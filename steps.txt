✅ NEXT STEPS AFTER GETTING map.osm
https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=18/23.176920/80.025476
Your map.osm file contains raw XML data like:

roads

footpaths

buildings

water bodies

POIs (if mapped)

campus boundary

But you cannot directly use this inside your app — you must convert + extract usable layers.

⭐ Step 1: Convert OSM to GeoJSON (easy)

You need:

roads.geojson

buildings.geojson

footpaths.geojson

poi.geojson

Use osmtogeojson (online)

Go here:
https://tyrasd.github.io/osmtogeojson/

Upload your map.osm
Download the .geojson output

OR use Python if you prefer (I can give the script).

⭐ Step 2: Extract Roads, Buildings, POIs Separately

OSM raw contains everything mixed, so split it:

Tool 1: geojson.io

Open your geojson

Select only buildings

Export as buildings.geojson

Repeat for roads, paths, areas

Tool 2 (better): osmnx (Python)

You can run:

import osmnx as ox

g = ox.graph_from_xml("map.osm")
ox.save_graphml(g, "graph.graphml")


This gives you:
✔ road network
✔ walkable graph
✔ ready for routing

⭐ Step 3: Build the routing engine

Choose one:

Option A (easy): GraphHopper

Download GraphHopper

Run:

graphhopper import map.osm


It generates a routing graph you can use in your app.

Option B (faster): OSRM
osrm-extract map.osm -p profiles/car.lua
osrm-contract map.osm.osrm


This gives:

turn-by-turn instructions

geometry for route

waypoints

⭐ Step 4: Load the campus map inside your app

Use:

Flutter

flutter_map + maplibre

Load roads.geojson & buildings.geojson as layers

React Native

react-native-maplibre

Add GeoJSON sources

Android Native

MapLibre GL SDK

Add layers for polyline (roads) and fill (buildings)

This gives you a custom standalone map of IIITDM.

⭐ Step 5: Add Crowdsourced Alerts

Design a model:

alert_id
lat
lon
alert_type
severity
description
timestamp
expires_at
user_id (optional)


Save in:

Firebase

Supabase

MongoDB

PostgreSQL

Then show alert pins on your map.

⭐ Step 6: AR on top of navigation

Later, once outer navigation works:

Use ARCore / Unity

Convert route coordinates → AR anchors

Show arrows, floating POIs, alert icons

🎯 YOU ARE 100% ON TRACK

Uploading map.osm is the hardest first step — now your data is ready to convert and use.
